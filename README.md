🍽️ Partania’s Mediterranean Bistro

This is a full restaurant website built as a portfolio project to reflect a 5-star Mediterranean dining experience.
The goal was to build something realistic — not just a demo — with real layout decisions, real logic, and clean styling.

This project was built from start to finish and focuses on both functionality and polish.
